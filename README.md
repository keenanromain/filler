# filler
The purpose of filler is to create a competitive AI that succeeds in placing a higher volume of random tetromino shapes against the stock AIs found in the resources directory. Each player is provided a starting location on a given map and must alternate between placing one piece per day. The game is complete when a player can no longer place a piece in accordance to the rules and the winner is determined why which program placed the most pieces. The rules of the game:

<ol>
  <li>Placement can only lie within the confines of the map.</li>
  <li>Each new piece must overlap with a single grid unit of the player's existing mass of tetrominos.</li>
  <li>There can be no overlapping with existing pieces placed on the board.</li>
</ol>

Example of a command to begin the game and the initial corresponding VM output:

## Key Details

The initial phase of this project was to become familiar with reading and parsing the filler virtual machine's output. As seen in the screenshot above, the filler_vm is executed with the -f flag to specificy the map for the game to be played on as well as the two different players via the -p1 and -p2 flags. After an initial message of credit to the VM's developers, the game begins.

In order of appearance, the VM outputs the map's dimensions, the map itself with coordinates along both the X-axis and Y-axis, the piece's dimenions, and the piece represented in this example as two asteriks: <br/>

In order to place the game piece on the board, each player must write out it's preferred coordinates to the standard out which is then received by the VM. To determine said preferred coordinates, the project specifications were entirely open-ended to permit creativity. The solution I came up with used a dynamic heat map for creating a maximum-cost path algorithm in order to place each piece on prime real estate. The algorithm initially prioritized the middle of the board before drawing a cross to limit the mobility of the opponent. From there, the vertical pillar expands outward taking up all open space in cyclical fashion. Before diving into the code, a few screenshots will be displayed of the algorithm in action:

## Implementation


Once inside the resources directory, the project can be run in the following format: 
```
./filler_vm -f maps/map02 -p1 players/carli.filler -p2 ../kromain.filler
```
